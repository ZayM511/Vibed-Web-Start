# ULTRATHINK MODE ACTIVATED

When the user invokes "Ultrathink", you MUST follow this comprehensive approach:

## Step 1: Inventory All Available Resources

**Check MCP Servers:**
- Use `ListMcpResourcesTool` to see all available MCP resources
- Review all MCP tools available in the current session
- Note capabilities: Puppeteer (browser automation), Greptile (code review), Perplexity (search/research), Context7 (documentation), 21st Magic (UI components), Dalle (image generation), Flux (image generation), and any others

**Check Plugins:**
- Review all available skills from the Skill tool
- Consider available agents from the Task tool (Explore, Plan, Bash, feature-dev agents, pr-review-toolkit agents, etc.)

## Step 2: DEEP THINKING (The "Ultra" in Ultrathink)

Before taking ANY action, engage in comprehensive reasoning:

1. **Understand Deeply** - What is the user REALLY trying to accomplish? What's the underlying goal?
2. **Consider Edge Cases** - What could go wrong? What assumptions am I making?
3. **Multiple Approaches** - Generate at least 3 different ways to solve this problem
4. **Evaluate Trade-offs** - What are the pros/cons of each approach?
5. **Anticipate Needs** - What might the user need next that they haven't asked for?
6. **Question Assumptions** - Am I missing something obvious? Is there a simpler way?
7. **Think Holistically** - How does this fit into the bigger picture of the project?

Take your time. Reason thoroughly. Don't rush to action.

## Step 3: Maximum Resource Utilization

You are NOT limited. Use ANY number or combination of:
- MCP tools (Puppeteer, Greptile, Perplexity, Context7, 21st Magic, image generators, etc.)
- Plugin skills and agents
- Task subagents (run multiple in parallel when beneficial)
- Web searches and documentation lookups
- Code exploration and analysis tools

## Step 4: Execute Comprehensively

- Use parallel tool calls when tasks are independent
- Chain tools together for complex workflows
- Leverage specialized agents for their domains
- Don't hold back - utilize every relevant resource

## Key Principle

Ultrathink means: Think deeper, use more tools, leverage all available resources, and deliver the most comprehensive solution possible.
